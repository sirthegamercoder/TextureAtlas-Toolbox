## Version History

### Version 3.0.x

_

#### Version 3.0.0
Release date: **TBD**

##### Highlights
- **UI overhaul**: 
    - **Screen-adaptive sizing**: Initial window dimensions scale to the user's display resolution down to 1280x720 as minimum.
    - **Themes added:** (Clean, Material, Fluent, Windows 95, Windows XP) each with Light, Dark, and AMOLED variants
    - **Accent colour presets**: Eight accent colour options (Default, Blue, Purple, Green, Red, Orange, Pink, Teal) applied across all theme families
    - **Step-based setup wizard**: Three-step first-launch wizard (Language → What's New → Theme) with a live preview panel showing sample widgets that restyle in real-time

##### New Features
- Experimental Feature: **GPU Texture Extraction & Compression**
    - Load and extract sprites from DDS and KTX2 GPU-compressed atlas images (BC1/BC3/BC7, ETC1, ETC2, ASTC, PVRTC) using `texture2ddecoder`
    - Generate GPU-compressed atlas images in BC1/DXT1, BC3/DXT5, BC7, ETC1, ETC2, ASTC, and PVRTC formats
    - Optionally generate full mipmap chains with Lanczos downsampling
    - Post-process optimized images with GPU texture compression in the optimizer tab
    - Store compressed textures in industry-standard DDS (DirectX) or KTX2 (Khronos) containers
    - Automatic padding enforcement — padding auto-clamped to block size when GPU format is active
    - Format-gated GPU controls — options only appear for metadata formats used by game engines
    - One-time disclaimer dialog on first GPU format selection
- Feature: **libGDX TexturePacker format**: New parser and exporter for libGDX TexturePacker `.atlas` files
- Feature: **EXIF metadata in WebP/AVIF**: Extracted WebP and AVIF frames now include EXIF metadata
- Feature: **Hierarchical sprite name paths**: Support hierarchical sprite names (e.g. `folder/sprite`) in export paths, preserving directory structure
- Feature: **Job progress window**: Dedicated batch-job progress tracking dialog
- Feature: **Logger**: Added logging to text files for most things in the app for easier bug reporting.
- Feature: **Drag-and-drop import**: Both Generator and Extractor tabs accept dropped files and folders. The Generator detects atlas + metadata pairs (auto-discovers sibling metadata in the source folder) and routes them through the existing-atlas import flow; folders are imported via the same scanner used by the "Add Folder" action; loose images prompt for a new spritesheet job vs. appending to the current one. The Extractor appends dropped items to the existing list (no clearing) and references files in place, skipping duplicates by display name. A translucent overlay with a centered hint label appears on drag-enter as a visual cue.
- Feature: **Multi-select batch operations**:
    - Generator's spritesheet/animation/frame tree gained `ExtendedSelection` with bulk delete via context menu and the Delete/Backspace key. A single confirmation prompt covers the whole selection; mixed selections of jobs/animations/frames are deduplicated so child items aren't deleted twice when their parent is also selected.
    - Extractor's spritesheet and animation lists no longer collapse the multi-selection on right-click. Override-settings dialogs now apply the chosen settings to every selected spritesheet (or animation) in one step.

##### Enhancements
- Enhancement: **Extract tab tree overhaul**: Frame counts and stats displayed per-animation in the tree view
- Enhancement: **Dialog consistency overhaul**: All dialog windows restyled for visual consistency across theme families
- Enhancement: **Directory → Folder standardisation**: All user-facing strings changed from "directory" to "folder" for consistency
- Enhancement: **Background atlas import**: Atlas import moved to background thread with progress indicator
- Enhancement: **Granular progress reporting**: Sub-progress reporting in atlas generator for more responsive progress bars
- Enhancement: **Format-specific sprite naming**: Generator now uses format-appropriate naming conventions for exported sprites (hopefully..)
- Enhancement: **JSON parser improvements**: JSON parsers now handle rotated dimensions, `frameTags`, and per-frame duration fields
- Enhancement: **Path sanitization utilities**: New `sanitize_path_name` and `basename_from_sprite_name` helpers
- Enhancement: **Frame signature accuracy**: Increase frame signature prefix from 512 to 2048 bytes for better deduplication
- Enhancement: **Unified progress windows**: Generator atlas generation, atlas import, and folder import now stream their summary, warnings, and final status into a single `JobProgressWindow` instead of opening separate `QMessageBox` popups when complete. Folder import previously had no progress window at all; it now matches the atlas-import flow.
- Enhancement: **More informative generator progress**: "Loading image N/M" messages are throttled (~20 updates total). When packing in automatic mode, the progress log surfaces every algorithm and heuristic the packer tries, the running best score, and the algorithm/heuristic ultimately selected.
- Enhancement: **Rotation-impossible formats (UIKit plist, Godot, Egret2D, TXT)** now raise UNSUPPORTED_FORMAT instead of silently swapping width/height; capability set centralised so GUI/packer/exporters share one source of truth

##### Bugfixes
- Bugfix: **Exporter spec compliance**: Spec-compliance fixes for Plist, Spine, and Aseprite exporters
- Bugfix: **Image.fromarray TypeError**: Fix TypeError in standalone/compiled builds when using `Image.fromarray`
- Bugfix: **ImageMagick errors**: Fix ImageMagick path issues on compiled/standalone builds
- Bugfix: **Error popup not displaying**: Fix `show_error_popup` never displaying when QApplication already exists
- Bugfix: **Preview generator variable**: Fix `UnboundLocalError` for `owns_temp_dir` in preview generator
- Bugfix: **Extract tab reset**: Remove duplicate `.clear()` calls in extract tab reset
- Bugfix: **Generator thread leak**: Stop generator worker thread on widget destruction
- Bugfix: **Temp directory leak**: Fix temp directory leak in `add_existing_atlas` on exception
- Bugfix: **Atlas size guard**: Add atlas size guard to prevent excessive memory allocation
- Bugfix: **Image load failure reporting**: Surface image load failures as warnings in generator result instead of silently failing
- Bugfix: **Parser error chaining**: Add exception chaining in base parser catch-all handler
- Bugfix: **File I/O error handling**: Add error handling for file I/O in Aseprite, TXT, and CSS legacy parsers

##### Optimizations
- Optimization: **O(1) frame dedup lookup**: Use set for O(1) `is_frame_already_added` lookup instead of list scan
- Optimization: **Faster single-frame check**: Use `np.array_equal` instead of `.tobytes()` in `is_single_frame`
- Optimization: **Flip hash reuse**: Reuse `flip_y` result when computing `flip_xy` hash
- Optimization: **Frame tuple caching**: Reuse cached frame tuples instead of rebuilding in non-smart grouping
- Optimization: **Memory management**: Close source images after atlas compositing to free memory

##### Tweaks / Removals
- Tweak: **CPU detection**: Grab CPU and thread count directly from registry as primary method, fallback to wmic
- Removed: **In-app User Manual**: Remove in-app manual and link to GitHub docs.

##### Atlas improvements
- **Aseprite**: parser/exporter rewritten to spec; full round-trip of frameTags, layers, slices, and per-sprite duration; new strict-aseprite and json-array modes; rotation direction (90° CW) now documented in code
- **Spine / libGDX .atlas**: rewritten to spec, both formats share one codepath; round-trips page metadata, modern and legacy region layouts, ninepatch data, custom name/value pairs, and multi-page atlases. Modern emit omits `offsets:`, `rotate:`, and `index:` lines whose values are defaults (untrimmed / unrotated / `index = -1`), matching the Spine 4.2 reference byte-for-byte.
- **Adobe Animate spritemaps**: now reads every sibling spritemap*.json page (stock + BTA overflow); BTA extension auto-detected; ASI references cross-linked with unresolved names recorded as warnings
- **Starling / Sparrow XML**: parser reads every documented SubTexture attribute including HaxeFlixel flipX/flipY; exporter gains pivot-propagation across animation strips for the Starling MovieClip convention
- **JSON Hash / JSON Array**: new parse_file captures full meta block and frameTags; exporters can emit per-frame durations, frame tags, and arbitrary extra meta (related_multi_packs, smartupdate, etc.). Soft watermark now lives in `meta.app` (`TextureAtlas Toolbox (<version>)`) so `meta.version` can keep carrying the TexturePacker schema version (`"1.0"`) that Phaser/PixiJS/Cocos loaders inspect.
- **Unity .tpsheet**: parser reads optional pivot columns and surfaces format/texture/size headers; exporter gains pivot_mode (always/never/auto) so a five-column source round-trips back to five columns
- **CSS exporter**: trim now encoded via background-position (SpriteSmith/sprity/Glue convention); rotation uses transform-origin: 0 0 + translateY to stay in layout slot; legacy modes still selectable; round-trip comment read back by CSS parser
- **TexturePacker XML**: parser captures root metadata and per-file attribute style; conflicting n/name pairs and unrecognised r= values now warn instead of disappearing; exporter chooses between short and long attribute names
- **Paper2D**: pivot is now conditional via pivot_mode (always/never/auto); a no-pivot atlas round-trips back to no-pivot; parser only attaches per-sprite pivots when the source frame declared one
- **TXT parser**: malformed lines now surface as warnings with line number and content instead of being dropped silently; legacy silent-skip helper preserved for compat
- **CSS parser**: reads transform: rotate markers and SpriteSmith/Glue/sprity margin trim offsets; long-form background-image + background-position accepted alongside the shorthand
- **Phaser 3**: rewritten to spec; all three schema variants (multi-atlas, JSONArray, JSONHash) are first-class with auto-detection, per-page tagging, and pivot/anchor decoding. `meta.app`/`meta.version` watermark mirrors the JSON Hash convention rather than overwriting the schema indicator.
- **TexturePacker plist (Cocos2d-x)**: rewritten to spec; auto-detects all four format versions; aliases and polygon-mesh data round-trip losslessly; page metadata captured; name.png.png doubling bug fixed

##### Dependencies
- Added: **etcpak** pip package for BC1/BC3/BC7/ETC1/ETC2 compression

_

#### Version 2.0.0 
Release date: **January 06, 2026**

*This is the biggest update yet.*


##### Highlights
- **Rebranded to TextureAtlas Toolbox**: The project has been renamed from "TextureAtlas to GIF and
  Frames" to better reflect its expanded capabilities beyond just extraction.

- **Complete UI rewrite in Qt (PySide6)**: The entire interface has been remade
  for improved responsiveness, accessibility, and cross-platform consistency.


- **New "Embedded Python" release variant**: 

  A new portable release option that bundles
  a complete and isolated Python environment.

  This is now the recommended way to run the application, as
  standalone `.exe` builds almost always trigger false positives in the most common antivirus softwares. This release type works as if it were an executable release by using `.bat` or `.sh` scripts to launch.

##### New Features
- Feature: **Automatic Dark/Light mode detection** 

- Feature: **Extended format support**: *Now supports 15+ TextureAtlas/Spritesheet formats and more image formats*

- Feature: **Generator Tab**: 
*Create texture atlases/spritesheets from individual frames—not just extract them.*

- Feature: **Editor Tab**: *Adjust per-frame offsets or combine frames from multiple animations into a single animation output.*

- Feature: **Multi-language support**: *Most languages are currently machine translated until community translations get added.*

- Feature: **Per-frame delay editing**: *Set custom durations for individual frames in animations through the Animation Preview window.*

- Feature: **Multiple duration input formats**: *Specify frame timing as fps, milliseconds (ms), centiseconds (cs), deciseconds (ds), or format-native units*

- Feature: **First-startup dialog**: *Asks user wheter they want to update notifications and language settings*

- Feature: **Resampling options**: *Support common resampling options for image scaling*

##### Enhancements
- Enhancement: **Significantly improved processing time**. Optimized the Extractor logic.

- Enhancement: **Frame duration precision**: Refactored calculations to hopefully prevent floating-point errors

##### Internal / Developer
- Added both quick and extensive tests which can be found in the `tests/` directory

- Setup scripts updated to install Python 3.14.0

- Rewritten most of the documentation instead of having fully AI generated documentation.

##### Translation Editor Tool (`tools/translator-app/`)
A new GUI application to help contributors translate TextureAtlas Toolbox into other languages without
needing developer tools like Qt Linguist.

- **Visual translation editor**: Edit `.ts` translation files with a clean, user-friendly interface

- **Smart string grouping**: Related strings are organized together for context

- **Placeholder syntax highlighting**: Visual feedback for `{variable}` placeholders

- **Real-time validation**: Warns about missing or malformed placeholders before saving

- **Machine translation support**: Optional DeepL, Google Translate, and LibreTranslate API integration

- **Customizable keyboard shortcuts**: Configure hotkeys to match your workflow

- **Theme support**: Light/dark themes.

- **Keyword filtering**: Quickly find specific translation strings

- **Obsolete string detection**: Identifies unused translations for cleanup

I may have missed some bugfixes/enhancements or features, but if I have, then this doc will be updated soon.

---

## Known Issues
- **Memory issues**: Adobe Spritemaps require a lot of processing time to be extracted, some spritemaps may take up to several minutes before it actually starts generating any output. This process takes more time depending on your RAM and CPU.

- **Incorrect output on Adobe Spritemaps**: In some cases depending on how the spritemap was made in Adobe Flash/Animate, output may either miss something or straight up have incorrect alignment, please report a new issue [here](https://github.com/MeguminBOT/TextureAtlas-Toolbox/issues) and attach your extracted output and the affected spritemap file(s) so it can be investigated.
